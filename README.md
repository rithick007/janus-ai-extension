Janus - Your AI Workflow Strategist üöÄ
An intelligent Chrome extension that acts as your personal AI consultant, recommending the best tools and strategies for any task.

‚ú® Key Features

Intelligent Agent Mode: If your task is vague or lacks detail (e.g., "help with my website"), Janus asks smart clarifying questions to understand your exact needs before making a recommendation.

Clean, Focused Recommendations: Get a simple, elegant list of the best AI tools for your task, each with a concise, single-sentence description of what it does best.

Seamless Context Menu: Simply right-click any text on a webpage and select "Analyze with Janus" to get started instantly.

State Persistence: Your last result is automatically saved. You can click away, close the popup, and come back to your recommendations at any time without losing them.

Secure & Private: Your free, personal Google Gemini API key is stored securely in your browser's local storage and is never transmitted to anyone other than the Google API.
